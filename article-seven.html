                        <h4 class="section-heading">Points To Consider for Successful Mobile Application</h4>
                        <p>I have compiled a list of top tips that, will help you in creating a mobile application. Let’s check one by one.</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Deep Market Research: The deep market analysis will reveal you about what users prefer and what they don’t want. Through deep market research, you will be capable to know your users and this thing will help you create a great mobile app. Through the help of deep market research, you will know about your opponents that they are giving the same features as you are intending to make? Thus, Examining the market completely will give you penetrations into your strengths, opponents policy, and their flaws too.</li>
                          <li>Design for Multiple Devices: You should always choose more than one platform for mobile app Development. The reason behind is the target audience that might prefer any method to operate, something which you can never check. But, still, it totally depends on you, whether you require going for various devices or a single platform.</li>
                          <li>Marketing: Marketing your app for getting more number of Play Store downloads is another vital thing, but at the same time, it is imperative that you <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/">retain your customers engaged</a> in using the app constantly. Interested consumers are more likely to deliver great reports, in-app purchases and so on.</li>
                          <li>Prototyping: Prototyping your app is the next vital thing you have to notice. Once you start making the app go for accelerated prototypes. I will suggest, begin with a pen and paper, test. Then, move further with the beta app testing. You have to endure testing at each step with your BETA users so that you can create specifically according to the requirement of your users.</li>
                          <li>App Design: Another significant determinant that determines an app’s earnings in the market, is the conception of your application. An app developer must focus on UI design, designing standards, multi-touch appearances and so on. User interface design represents essential role in the progress of your app, so your emphasis should be on the design as well.</li>
