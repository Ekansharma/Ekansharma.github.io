                        <p>Listen Man,</p>
                        <p>You think by offering a drink and passing on some of these cheesy pick-up lines, you can get her number?</p>
                        <p>Well, buddy, here is a reality check for you. At present, what I can tell you is that she is a young, smart, confident and beautiful woman who has grown accustomed to men like you trying to get her attention and sweep off her feet.</p>
                        <p>Based on all the experiences she has had, as per me, her decision making process is quite refined as it has learned it over the years, as this process can easily be described as a machine learning process, especially based on neural networks, which actually is the case.</p>
                        <p>The different variables which affect this process for such a woman are quite extensive considering her intellect. The weight-age she gives to these different variables that she consider while considering a man as her potential boyfriend is quite unfathomable for a guy like you as you can’t even imagine what a woman like her, look for a man. After all this, the threshold set by her in her decision making process, for her potential partner, is quite high and varies as per the conditions and her present state of mind.</p>
                        <p>Even if you keep on giving the right input which matches the variables she consider and gives significant weight-age to, there is another factor you don’t know that when it comes to reward rate to input received which is a natural decay process like a leaky capacitor. So, even if you get the chance to get her attention, it will decrease over the time.</p>
                        <p>I can easily see that there is no spark among you and you aren’t a starkly attractive and genuine person who can deliver a Dirac-Delta type input which can clear her threshold instantaneously, that you guys call it off as hitting it off or love at first sight.</p>
                        <p>After all the ramblings I have done, I haven’t even mentioned the competition that you are facing from guys like you in this bar and some of them are better competitors.</p>
                        <p>So, why don’t you move along and give this lady sometime to blow off some steam with her friends, have a good time without getting bothered by guys like you and leave the people sitting next to her, hearing these miserable attempts.</p>
                        <p>So, move along and give the lady her privacy.</p>
